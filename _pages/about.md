# About Me
* I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Actuarial Science at the University of Waterloo (UW), supervised by Prof. [Ruodu Wang](http://sas.uwaterloo.ca/~wang/).
* I received my M.Phil. Degree in Mathematics and B.Sc. Degree in Mathematics and Economics at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by Prof. [Yue Kuen Kwok](https://www.math.ust.hk/~maykwok/).
* My research interests include actuarial science, quantitative risk management, operations research, financial engineering, and game theory.

# News
* It is my great pleasure to be selected as one of the two recipients of the **Comprehensive Award** for 2020 by the department. 
* The **2nd Waterloo Student Conference in Statistics, Actuarial Science and Finance** (online on Nov 5 & 6, 2021) was held successfully, for which I served as one of the student co-chairs with Kelly Ramsay. We would like to thank everyone for her/his great contributions to the conference. The 3rd conference is planned to be held physically in 2022. We look forward to seeing everyone face to face.
* It is a great honor for me to be selected as one of the four recipients of the [James C. Hickman Scholar Doctoral Stipend](https://www.soa.org/resources/announcements/press-releases/2021/hickmans-scholar/) from the Society of Actuaries (SOA) for the 2021--2022 academic year.
* We are hosting a [weekly seminar on risk management and actuarial science](https://yang-liu16.github.io/seminar/). Due to COVID-19, we have switched the seminars to online sessions via Zoom. Researchers all over the world interested in quantitative risk management, actuarial science and mathematical finance are welcomed to join us by sending emails to me, [Yang Liu](https://yang-liu16.github.io/), or [Liyuan Lin](https://liyuan-lin.github.io/Liyuan/).
